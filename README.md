Use
----

Intended to be used with data in `/data` directory.

To pull and run first time. 

    docker run -v /data:/data -itd fomightez/bowtie1

You may need to change first `/data` in that command to match path to your directory.

It starts detached and so you need to attach it, alternative use `docker run -v /data:/data -it fomightez/bowtie1` to start and attach immediately.
